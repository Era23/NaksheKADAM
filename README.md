# Nakshekadam-SIH

The team’s solution : “NaksheKADAM” is a mobile application which aims to be a one-stop solution to all the career-based needs of an average 9th to 12th grader in the Indian education system. It would break-down all the salient requirements of an unaided 9th to 12th grader alongside their concerned parents through its unique AI-powered backend. The roadmap of the app is divided into a pre-login and post-login segment, both of which would have their specific purposes to accomplish every necessity under this domain. The pre-login would mainly cater to making all the necessary resources for the said age group accessible through scrutinized types that can be surfed within one application, while the post log-in would have specified tests that could personalize career-based recommendations on a multitude of parameters. The application would thus have specified logins for students, parents as well as industry counselors with many innovative functionalities like - chat-bot based data accessibility, AI powered recommendations via questionnaires/tests that would efficiently quantify a student’s interests, aptitude, academic background, personality and many more relevant details as parameters, opportunities and choices that are not very well-known in the current educational landscape, one-to-one counselor bookings and many more things being clubbed together.
